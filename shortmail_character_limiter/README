Roundcube plugin shortmail character limiter
============================================

Introduction
------------
This plugin limits the characters of an email to 500 if the used IMAP host
is shortmail (http://shortmail.com).

Installation
------------
Put the shortmail_character_limiter folder into the plugin folder and enable the
plugin by adding shortmail_character_limiter into the
$rcmail_config['plugins'] array.

You can copy config/config.inc.php.dist to config/config.inc.php if you want to
modify it.


Bug
---
There is a bug when I tested the Plugin. I only can write 498 characters in an
shortmail. With more shortmail refuses the mail with the reason that there are
too many characters. Please try out the plugin and send my your experiences.

-------------
You can change the IMAP host to another than imap.shortmail.com.
You can set the character limit to another than 500.
